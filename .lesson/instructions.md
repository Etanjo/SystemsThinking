# Systems Design Challenge

For this project, your challenge is going to be to create a beautiful digital template that can be used to present systems ideas.

For this project, I'd like you to pick a systems tool we use at our school, such as:

- The Iceberg Model
- Connection Circles & Feedback Loops
- Behavior Over Time Graphs
- Stock & Flow models

If you want some more information about tools, here are some helpful resources:
- [iceberg models](https://untools.co/iceberg-model)
- [connection circles](https://untools.co/connection-circles)
- [feedback loops](https://untools.co/balancing-feedback-loop)

Your goal will be:

1. Break the tool into requisite "components" that you can build in svelte.
2. Create a prototype of your tool with a stand-alone example of your model (for example, a website that shows a particular feedback loop).
3. Create a system whereby it is possible to edit and author new examples of your explanation. Examples could include URL-based schemes, using a google doc or spreadsheet as a simple "API", or using an actual database-backed website.

## Inspirations:

Here are some examples you could use from past years:
[Connection Circle Tool, from IACS Web Design 2 Student Abbie Lyna](https://fresher-st-with-json-abigail-lyna--abbielyna.repl.co/)
[Loopy, an awesome feedback loop tool from Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/loopy/)
[The parable of the polygons: a gamified lesson from math vlogger/teacher Vi Hart and web designer Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/polygons/)

## Options

You can take this on as an individual or as a group or several groups.

## Steps:
- Get your initial design looking good.
- Come up with a color scheme, set of fonts, and visual language that is appealing.
- Choose your target device: I would recommend designing for both a chromebook and a mobile phone as those are our most commonly used devices at school.
- Choose your example systems explanation: try to make it a real explanation, perhaps drawn from another class, rather than simply using Lorem Ipsum text.
- Build your prototype!
